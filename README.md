# Car-Insurance-Claim-Prediction

This research focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to analyze and predict insurance claim submissions by vehicle policyholders. 

In this study, we applied three different classifiers: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Tree, and Na√Øve Bayes Classifier. Each of these classifiers was trained both in the original feature space and in the reduced dimensionality space obtained using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm.
